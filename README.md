# Hackingtools
Using a non-pentesting distro or working on one, but don't want to manually install all the hacking tools ? I got your back!
It's a simple text file but it'll save you a ton of time, you can install the entire text file or manually select the tools you want to use !

# WARNING READ THIS WARNING READ THIS WARNING READ THIS
THIS MIGHT BREAK YOUR SYSTEM + SOME TOOLS MIGHT NOT WORK
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF THEY BREAK YOUR SYSTEM, USE THEM CAREFULLY AND EDIT WHATEVER YOU DON'T LIKE

# Usage

First off, clone the repository
``` git clone ``` 
Secondly, choose which pack you want to install and do the following command
If you're on a debian based distro
``` sudo apt install -r YOURPACK.txt ``` 
change the package manager if you're on a diffrent Distro + change the " -r " argument too

# How it works
It's really simple, the apt package manager or whatever package manager you're using reads the text file and installs whatever is in it, the " -r " is the argument responsible for it
I know it's not much, but maybe it'll save someones valuable time
